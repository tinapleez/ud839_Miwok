Notes for Lessons on Audio Focus
Global variables created for the AudioManager instance, and the Listener:


    /** Handles audio focus when playing a sound file */
    private AudioManager mAudioManager;
    /**
     * This listener gets triggered whenever the audio focus changes
     * (i.e., we gain or lose audio focus because of another app or device).
     */
    private AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener mOnAudioFocusChangeListener = new AudioManager.OnAudioFocusChangeListener() {
        @Override
        public void onAudioFocusChange(int focusChange) {
            if (focusChange == AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT ||
                    focusChange == AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK) {
                // The AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT case means that we've lost audio focus for a
                // short amount of time. The AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK case means that
                // our app is allowed to continue playing sound but at a lower volume. We'll treat
                // both cases the same way because our app is playing short sound files.

                // Pause playback and reset player to the start of the file. That way, we can
                // play the word from the beginning when we resume playback.
                mMediaPlayer.pause();
                mMediaPlayer.seekTo(0);
            } else if (focusChange == AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN) {
                // The AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN case means we have regained focus and can resume playback.
                mMediaPlayer.start();
            } else if (focusChange == AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS) {
                // The AUDIOFOCUS_LOSS case means we've lost audio focus and
                // Stop playback and clean up resources
                releaseMediaPlayer();
            }
        }
    };

onCreate method, 

        // Create and setup the {@link AudioManager} to request audio focus
        mAudioManager = (AudioManager) getSystemService(Context.AUDIO_SERVICE);

added to onItemClickListener:

                // Request audio focus so in order to play the audio file. The app needs to play a
                // short audio file, so we will request audio focus with a short amount of time
                // with AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT.
                int result = mAudioManager.requestAudioFocus(mOnAudioFocusChangeListener,
                        // Use the music stream.
                        AudioManager.STREAM_MUSIC,
                        // Request transient focus.
                        AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT);

                if (result == AudioManager.AUDIOFOCUS_REQUEST_GRANTED) {
                    // Start playback since we now have audio focus
                    
                    //(create and start MediaPlayer)
                    }


releaseMediaPlayer method modification - Abandon Audio Focus


            // Regardless of whether or not we were granted audio focus, abandon it. This also
            // unregisters the AudioFocusChangeListener so we don't get anymore callbacks.
            mAudioManager.abandonAudioFocus(mOnAudioFocusChangeListener);
